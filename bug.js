```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration ...
module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations ...
  content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```
In this configuration, the `content` option is incorrectly specified.  The path './node_modules/flowbite/**/*.js' includes all Javascript files within the flowbite node module, which is likely unnecessary and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Tailwind CSS might attempt to process these files, causing build issues or unexpected styles being applied to your project.  This can lead to build errors or incorrect styling depending on the contents of the flowbite files.
